# Extras-menu
## A collection of different scripts to use in GMRSlive.
### Might also work on Allstar but I did not test it so use it at your own risk.
### I am not liable for whatever happens to your NODE. 
### I have tested on the GMRSLive v2.1.3 image and with the exception of gTTS (Google Text To Speech) nothing else needs to be installed. All that is needed it's already on the Pi.


### Some of these scripts already have a version of them in the GMRSlive image, they are not that easy to use and all are command line. For a newbie that doesn't know his way around the BASH Shell or command prompt, I hope I made it a bit easier.

## Scripts included
- menu.sh
- cronJ.sh
- gsmbi.py
- *astdb.php
- *cpu_stats.sh
- *reboot.sh
- *firsttime.sh
- The scripts with a * are already on the Pi. I am just making it easier to use.
